# elixir-alchemist-camp
 Self-coded examples along the episodes from <a href="https://alchemist.camp/" target="_blank">alchemist.camp</a> with the aim to refresh programming skills in Elixir/OTP.
 I can recommend the course for online learning if you already have some Elixir skills or programming experience.
 The examples might slightly differ to the ones in the course as I sometimes took a slightly different approach / added own ideas in implementation.
